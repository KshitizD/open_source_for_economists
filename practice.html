<h1>Practice<a class="headerlink" href="#practice" title="Permalink to this headline">Â¶</a></h1>
<p>Once you leave the university and start working at a firm, bank,
management consultancy, ministry etc. you can make two mistakes with
the knowledge you have gathered.</p>
<p>The first is that you try to stay too close to the ideal models that
we gave you. E.g. you write down a model and start to differentiate
and none of your colleagues has a clue what you are doing. Or you wait
for the perfect data set to answer the question you were asked (with
the right variables and instruments), but that data set does not
arrive (in time).</p>
<p>The second mistake is that you drop all the structure that we offered
you and start chatting away as if you never did any economics at all.</p>
<p>Of course, if you can get the data to make the right decision or if
you have time to start working on a model from scratch, by all means
do so. And, yes, when you are in a meeting and are asked a question, the
best you can do is to chat away (hopefully in an informed matter) as
there is no time for anything else.</p>
<p>But most of the time, your organization will ask you to find out
something in a couple of days, not a couple of weeks. Then the trick
is to quickly find relevant information (e.g. from the web), put
structure on it and present it in a way that is easy to follow but
does allow others to replicate your analysis.</p>
<p>For these type of situations, writing papers in MS Word or pdf is not
ideal. People cannot readily verify what you have done as the code is
separated from the description.</p>
<p>In this course, we will teach you to create an iPython <a class="reference external" href="http://ipython.org/notebook.html">notebook</a>. In the
notebook, you combine explanation and code. People can run the
notebook to check what you have done. You can export the notebook to
html and publish it on a website, see for <a class="reference external" href="http://janboone.github.io/Deductible_Health_Insurance/">example</a>. <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com">Github</a> allows you
to publish the html and the source code (notebook) on the same server
as is done <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/janboone/Deductible_Health_Insurance">here</a>. This allows people to download or clone the work you
have done and replicate it.</p>
<p>By the end of this course, you will be able to do this yourself. In
fact, your <a class="reference internal" href="assignment.html#id1"><em>assignment</em></a> is going to be exactly this!</p>
