Python
======

.. _python:

We use python as programming language. I guess, a fair question is:
why python? The non-scientific answer is: because I like it a lot.

Other answers, better motivated than my own, include:

* `<https://www.stat.washington.edu/~hoytak/blog/whypython.html>`_
* `<http://blog.monitor.us/2014/10/why-python-is-becoming-so-popular/>`_
* `<http://cyrille.rossant.net/why-using-python-for-scientific-computing/>`_
* `<https://sites.google.com/site/pythonforscientists/python-vs-matlab>`_
* google the question if you want more answers.

We will program python using the ipython or jupyter notebook. 
One motivation to use the ipython notebook is based on a paper in the AER: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oP9Qcjq8UVI
Note that this is a presentation on a python conference having nothing to do with
economics. The fact that this presentation uses an AER paper to
motivate using the notebook, may induce a wee pause in which you
ponder the state of our discipline.


After this pause, take a look at some notebooks:

Introduction to python for economists
-------------------------------------

simple introduction
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A first very simple introduction to python can be found `here <http://janboone.github.io/competition_policy_and_regulation/Introduction_to_Python/Introduction_to_Python.html>`_

With browsers like Safari, Chrome etc., you can see the notebook
online, rendered by GitHub:

* `<https://github.com/janboone/competition_policy_and_regulation/blob/gh-pages/_downloads/Introduction_to_Python.ipynb>`_
* you can download the notebook at `<http://janboone.github.io/competition_policy_and_regulation/_downloads/Introduction_to_Python.ipynb>`_


introduction for economists
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  
  
An introduction notebook that focuses on the two tools that economists need
(optimization and equilibrium) can be

* viewed as html `here <Intro_to_python_for_economists/Intro_to_python_for_economists.html>`_ and
* :download:`downloaded here <Intro_to_python_for_economists.ipynb>`.
