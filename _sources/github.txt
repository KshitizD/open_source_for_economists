GitHub
======

.. _github1:

We assume that you have installed all the software on the previous
:ref:`page <install>`. Now we start using GitHub_. GitHub allows you
to collaborate with others. This is also the way that you publish your
assignments so that we can grade them.

An introduction to GitHub can also be found `here <http://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/GitHub-Account-Setup-and-Configuration>`_ 

Although we will go over GitHub basics below and in class, the goal of this course is that you can find your way around open source software yourself; including finding the information on how to use it. Hence look for a GitHub tutorial on the web and read it carefully.


But basically it boils down to the following:

Sign up
-------

Go to the GitHub_ page and click on the green "sign up" button at the
top. At the join_ GitHub page, you set up a personal account. Fill in
the required information and click the green "Create an account"
button.

In step 2 choose the free account. Then move on to your dashboard
(step 3).




Set up Git
----------

Next, we need to set up Git on your computer (which you installed
before) to work with GitHub: this page explains how to set up Git_ for
this purpose. Follow all the steps described on this page. That is,
both "Setting up Git" and "Next steps: Authenticating with GitHub from
Git". 

When it comes to "Authenticating with GitHub from Git" follow the recommended route of "Connecting over HTTPS". 



Repository
----------

.. note::

   GitHub has changed the style of its webpages since the screenshots below were made; hence what you will see is not identical but it will be close enough for you to understand what you should be doing


* Now create your first repository_. Call this, for instance, "first-repo":

.. image:: /images/github_repo_1.png
   :scale: 90 %
   :align: center
		   
* Click on "Create repository", and then you see (but not the arrow...):

		   
.. image:: /images/github_repo_2.png
   :scale: 90 %
   :align: center

* if you are creating your "second-repo" as asked below; you can stop
  here and continue where you left_.

		   
* Click on "Settings"

.. image:: /images/github_repo_3.png

* Click on "Launch automatic page generator"

.. image:: /images/github_repo_4.png
   :scale: 90 %
   :align: center

* Leave the text as it is and click on "Continue to layouts"


.. image:: /images/github_repo_5.png
   :scale: 90 %
   :align: center

* Choose one of the themes at the top ("Cayman", "Slate" etc.) and
  click "Publish page" 

.. image:: /images/github_repo_6.png
   :scale: 90 %
   :align: center

* At the top you see the web address at which your page is
  published. Type this address in a browser and enjoy!

* Also note the branch name "master"

* by clicking on it, you can switch to the branch "gh-pages". The file
  "index.html" is the one that GitHub shows when someone goes to the
  address http://janboone.github.io/first-repo/

Command line
------------	  

.. _second-repo:

Let's create a second repository and use the command line. We are
going to use files from `<https://github.com/ryangray/buttondown>`_. Later,
you will be able to clone this repository, but we are not that far,
yet. Hence, you can download the relevant files below.

Note that below you need to type in (or copy/paste) some shell/terminal commands that you do not understand (yet). Don't worry about this now; later in the course we come back to this.


* Create a new repository, say "second-repo", using the steps above.

.. _left:
  
* Using Windows Explorer on Windows (Finder on Mac) or whatever
  program you like, create a new directory "github" in a place that
  you can navigate to using the command line. On Windows, you may want
  to create it as "C:\\github"; on Mac as "~/github".


On Linux and Mac computers, "~" indicates your home-directory. On most terminals you can use the "tab" key to complete what you are typing. Hence typing "~/git 'tab'" will complete to "~/github"; unless you have a directory "~/gitty" in which case the terminal will ask you which completion you want. Similarly for "C:\\git" on Windows.

  
* Go to your command line (e.g. command prompt under Windows or
  another console; Terminal or iTerm2 under Mac, whatever you
  installed :ref:`here <install>`).

* Navigate to the new directory "github" by typing at the command line
  either :command:`cd C:\\github` or :command:`cd ~/github` (whatever directory you chose
  to create)

* Type at the command line: :command:`git clone
  https://github.com/janboone/second-repo` where you change
  "/janboone/second-repo" to your own user name (instead of
  "janboone") and the name of the repository just created (if you did
  not choose "second-repo")

* The terminal will give output like

::
  
  Cloning into 'second-repo'...
  remote: Counting objects: 3, done.
  remote: Total 3 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0), pack-reused 0
  Unpacking objects: 100% (3/3), done.
  Checking connectivity... done.  

* Note that at this point there is no need to understand what you are
  typing here and why. This will become clear later

* Type: :command:`cd second-repo`

* :command:`git checkout --orphan gh-pages`

::

  Switched to a new branch 'gh-pages'

* :command:`git rm -rf .` --note that this is "-rf [space] ."

::

  rm 'README.md'
   
* :command:`touch .nojekyll` --this is step is (only) necessary if you want to
  use sphinx; clearly, the step should be skipped if you do want to use Jekyll.

.. _buttondown:
  
* Download the following two files and copy them to your directory
  "github/second-repo". That is, "C:\\github\\second-repo" on Windows if
  you followed the instructions above or "~/github/second-repo" on
  Mac. These are the two files from `<https://github.com/ryangray/buttondown>`_:

    * :download:`the markdown file <pandoc_example.md>`
    * :download:`the css style file <buttondown.css>`

* Use pandoc to covert the markdown file "pandoc_example.md" into an
  html file (here "index.html") using the style information from
  "buttondown.css"
	   
    * :command:`pandoc pandoc_example.md -s -c buttondown.css -o index.html`
	  
* To see what a css file does for html, we also convert to html
  without the css file:
	  
    * :command:`pandoc pandoc_example.md -o NoCss.html`

* :command:`git add .`

* :command:`git commit -a -m "First pages commit"`

* Go to the website: "http://janboone.github.io/second-repo/" where
  you change "janboone" into your own github user name and
  "second-repo" into the name of your own second repository. Note that it may take some time before your changes are published on line.

.. _webaddress:



* At http://janboone.github.io/second-repo/NoCss.html you can see the
  page where pandoc created the html from the markdown file without
  the css file.
