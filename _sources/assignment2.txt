Second assignment
=================

.. _assignment2:

Take an assignment you have done for another course in the MSc, where
you use math in the assignment. Then type the assignment in markdown
using Latex to type math. That is, the assignment needs to contain
math so that you can show us that you can use Latex.

Note that the idea here is to show us what you have learned so far
about using open source software. In other words, using an assignment
where there is hardly any math and hardly any text is unlikely to
impress us. Instead, if you also include a figure in your file this will
raise your grade.


part A
------

As with the :ref:`first assignment <assignment1>`, publish both the
markdown file and html file on github and send us the github-address
of both the repository and the published version (ending like
"assignment.html"). 

part B
------

Starting from the same markdown file with your assignment make an html
presentation using pandoc. Publish the presentation in the same
repository (both the markdown file "presentation.md"  and the one with an ending like "presentation.html").
