Second assignment
=================

.. _assignment2:

Take an assignment you have done for another course in the MSc, where
you use math in the assignment. Then type the assignment in markdown
using Latex to type math. That is, the assignment needs to contain
math so that you can show us that you can use Latex.

part A
------

As with the :ref:`first assignment <assignment1>`, publish both the
markdown file and html file on github and send us the github-address
of both the repository and the published version (ending like
"assignment.html"). 

part B
------

From the same markdown file with your assignment make an html
presentation using pandoc. Publish the presentation in the same
repository (with an ending like "presentation.html").
