Using Git
=========

.. _git:

Git is a version control system. There is a bit of a learning curve,
but once you master it, it simplifies your life considerably.

As we saw :ref:`before <github1>`, it helps you to publish your work on
GitHub.

Second, as the name "version control" suggests, it helps you
to keep control of different versions. Hence, not need to call your
files "file_v2_a" anymore. You change your files and "commit" the
changes, Git keeps track of the different versions.

Third, it allows you to collaborate with (many) others. You and your
collaborators can work on the same file. Git/GitHub offers a way to
track changes and merge changes into the main file. Here we explain
how this works.

Note that you've already seen a number of Git-commands :ref:`here <github1>` 
when we were using GitHub. Here we will explain what these commands
actually mean.

As before, there are numerous Git tutorials on the web. You can either
google or look at the following:

* `<https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/>`_
* `<https://progit.org/>`_
* on how to collaborate: `<https://help.github.com/categories/collaborating/>`_

Workflow
--------

working on one branch
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Let's create a third repository on GitHub, using the steps :ref:`here <github1>`.

* Create a new repository, say "third-repo".

* Go to your command line and navigate to your directory "github"

* Type at the command line: "git clone
  https://github.com/janboone/third-repo" where you change
  "/janboone" to your own user name (instead of
  "janboone")

* the repository that you just created on GitHub is now copied
  ("cloned") to your computer.

* again we stop using "" around the commands that you type at the
  command line. Type the following to change into the directory
  "third-repo" ("cd" stands for Change Directory):
  
* cd third-repo/

* start your markdown editor (whichever one you installed) and create
  a file "document.md" in this directory "github/third-repo". Type
  some text here.

* The following command adds all files in the directory to be tracked
  by Git:
  
* git add .

* the files are now "staged" and the following command adds these
  files to the next "commit" (with the "-m" flag, you add a message):
  
* git commit -m "First version of document"

  * optional: you can skip the "git add" part, if you use the "-a"
	flag: 
  * git commit -a -m "First version of document"

* if you want to see what you have changed, type either of the
  following (depending how much information you want):

  * git log -p
  * git log --stat
  
* the files are pushed to GitHub with the following command:

* git push origin master

* Go to the website: "http://janboone.github.io/third-repo/" where
  you change "janboone" into your own github user name.


* You can see that there are 2 commits now:

.. image:: /images/github_repo_8.png
   :scale: 90 %
   :align: center

* click on "commits" and you see what they are:

  * the initial commit when we created the repository
  * and the document file created above which we committed with the
	message "First version of this document"
		   
.. image:: /images/github_repo_9.png
   :scale: 90 %
   :align: center

* click on "First version of this document" and you can see what we
  changed here. That is, you see the text that you typed in your editor
			 
.. image:: /images/github_repo_10.png
   :scale: 90 %
   :align: center


* now change document.md by typing some changes to this file with your
  editor. Delete some words and add some sentences etc.

* git commit -a -m "Second version of document"

* git push origin master		   

* again go to the GitHub website as above

* you can see that there are 3 commits now

* click on each commit to see what you have changed.

branching out
~~~~~~~~~~~~~  


* With the following command we create a new branch called "testbranch":

* git branch testbranch

* now we switch to this new branch:

* git checkout testbranch

* go back to your file document.md and change something in this file again

* git commit -a -m "Third version of this document in the testbranch"

* git push origin testbranch

* go back to your github website; you will see something like:
  
.. image:: /images/github_repo_11.png
   :scale: 90 %
   :align: center

* the site notes that you pushed "testbranch"

* click on "branch master" and you can choose between the master
  branch and the testbranch branch:
		   
.. image:: /images/github_repo_12.png
   :scale: 90 %
   :align: center

* compare the version of document.md in each branch. 
		   
* with "git checkout master" you switch back to the master branch. You
  can change things here which will not affect the testbranch etc.

  * in case you get an error message here: you can only checkout of a
	branch if all your changes are committed
  
* after you typed "git checkout master", use your editor to open the
  file document.md on your computer. Hence, your file document.md on
  your computer has switched back to the previous version (i.e. the
  changes you made in testbranch have gone in this version; by typing
  "git checkout testbranch" you see this version again)

* the following command gives an overview of your branches:
  
* git log --oneline --decorate --graph --all  

* Now suppose that you are happy with the changes you made in
  testbranch. Then you would like to have these changes in the master
  branch as well. For this we "merge" the changes into the master branch

* first switch back to master (in case you had not done so yet):
  
* git checkout master

* and merge the changes from testbranch into master:
  
* git merge testbranch	

* Note: if in the meantime you have also changed document.md in the
  master branch, Git cannot merge two versions. See `here
  <http://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Basic-Branching-and-Merging#Basic-Merge-Conflicts>`_
  on how to deal with this.

* if you want, you can delete the testbranch now (all changes have
  been merged into master): "git branch -d testbranch", but you don't
  have to.
