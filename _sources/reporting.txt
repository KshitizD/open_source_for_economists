Reporting your results
======================




Here we discuss ways to report results on the web. Markdown,
Restructuredtext, Latex

Lecture can be found :download:`here <lectures/markdown_github.html>`


Markdown
--------

For the first assignment it is useful to know a bit of markdown. You can
either google "markdown tutorial" or use one of the following websites:

- `<http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/>`_
- `<https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet>`_
- `<https://help.github.com/articles/markdown-basics/>`_


Also note that once you know how to work with markdown, it becomes
easy to make presentations in html. See for instance:
`<http://pandoc.org/demo/example9/producing-slide-shows-with-pandoc.html>`_. This
you can try at home!

If you want to see an example of this. Look at the github repository
`<https://github.com/janboone/Private_contracts_health_care/tree/gh-pages>`_
which contains the markdown file of a presentation (hence you can
copy/clone this). The presentation then looks as follows:

`<http://janboone.github.io/Private_contracts_health_care/presentation_Toulouse.html#/>`_

Hence, when you give your presentation, you only need a browser and
the address of the presentation.

If you want to experiment a bit with this, download :download:`the zip
file <markdown_presentation.zip>`. Unzip this file and open the
markdown file presentation.md. The file also gives the commands to
create html or pdf presentations from the markdown file.

Note that to edit a markdown file, you use the editor you installed before.


Latex
-----

For the second assignment it is useful to familiarize yourself with
latex. Note that you do not need to type a whole document in latex (so
don't worry about preambles etc.), you just need to know how to type
\\(x^2\\), \\(\\alpha,\\beta\\) or have math displayed like

\\begin{equation}
a^2 + b^2 = c^2
\\end{equation}

Google "latex tutorial" or go to pages like:

* `<http://users.dickinson.edu/~richesod/latex/latexcheatsheet.pdf>`_
* `<http://www.latex-tutorial.com/tutorials/beginners/lesson-4/>`_
* `<http://www.andy-roberts.net/writing/latex/mathematics_1>`_

and focus on typesetting.


reStructuredText
----------------

.. _sphinx-github:

If you like the way the webpages of this course look, you can combine
sphinx with GitHub pages. An example tutorial for this is:

* `<http://daler.github.io/sphinxdoc-test/includeme.html>`_

reStructuredText is similar to markdown, but not identical. Markdown is a bit simpler, so stick to that if you do want further complications. For the assignments, there is not need to work with reStructuredText.
