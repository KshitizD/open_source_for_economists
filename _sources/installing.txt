Installing the stuff
====================

.. _install:

*Disclaimer*: below we describe the software that you need to
install for this course. Although we are not aware of any problems with these
programs, we cannot accept responsibility in case anything goes wrong
with your computer. Also, when you use this software, make sure
to save regularly and back up your work.

We need to install quite some software. This will be a bit of work and
things are bound to go wrong. So switch on some music_ and go ahead!

This is the first hurdle that you need to take to use open source
software. If you get an error message during installation, copy the
error message and google it. In 99 percent of the cases this will
solve your problem. If not; ask me in class.

.. this is quite a bit of work but stay with it...


Required installs for this course:
----------------------------------

* First, we install Latex_. Latex is great to write your MSc thesis
  in. For this course, we need it to convert and display math in the
  different file types that we will use.
* Next, install Pandoc_. Pandoc is an incredible piece of software. It
  allows you to easily move between different formats. See the demos_
  on the Pandoc website. We will be publishing a lot in html, but the
  last thing you want is to actually type html. With Pandoc you don't
  need to. You type in an "easy" language like Markdown_ or
  reStructuredText_ and then convert to html (or reveal.js_ to make a
  presentation).
* As we will be working with GitHub_, we need to install Git_. No need
  to install a fancy GUI, as we will be working with the command line.

  * if you need more help here,
	`<http://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git>`_
	may be useful and
	`<http://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-First-Time-Git-Setup>`_.

* Windows has a command-prompt_ installed by default. It is probably
  not the best terminal you can use. Here is a discussion of better
  consoles_ for windows. Note that the last link points to
  stackoverflow_; a website that you will be visiting a lot in the
  coming weeks!
* If you have a Mac, the application you need is called Terminal. But
  you may want to install iTerm2_, as it is more fancy and easier to
  work with.
* The program language that we use for this course is python_ which we
  will use with the ipython_ or `Jupyter <https://jupyter.org/>`_ notebook interface. You can install these
  things separately, but it is easier to install everything
  together. The best way to do this is to use the anaconda_
  distribution. Make sure to install python 2.7 (not 3.0) [#]_. See the
  quantitative_ economics website on how to install anaconda. If for
  some reason you cannot get anaconda installed, ask us in class and
  we will help. As an alternative you can choose
  canopy_. If even that gives problems, you can also work in
  the cloud with wakari_. But my guess is that this will be
  slower. We recommend to work with anaconda.

  



Optional:
---------

If you like the way this website looks, you may want to install:

* sphinx_. With sphinx you work with reStructuredText. You can also
  export your notebooks to reStructuredText to integrate them with
  sphinx, but you do not have to. Integrating sphinx with GitHub is a
  but tricky, but we can explain how this works.


We will be editing a lot of text files. Clearly, you can use MS Word
or other office type software to do this, but this is not recommended
(you probably guessed this). Most operating systems have a simple
editor installed, like notepad on Windows. This may be a bit "too
basic".

You can install different editors for different purposes.

* For Latex on Windows, winedt_ is a popular choice.
* Others like TeXworks_.
* A Markdown editor for Windows is: MarkdownPad_. On Mac you can use:
  MacDown_ or Mou_. You can also google "markdown editor" and then add
  your operating system to the query.
* Similarly, if you want to use reStructuredText, you need another
  editor. This page gives an overview of rst-editors_.

Alternatively, you can install an editor that can deal with any
file. That is, the editor recognizes what type of file you are editing
and adapts its behaviour accordingly. Basically, there are two popular
editors that can do this and there is a war_ between them.

* Emacs_ is a great editor. It has a bit of a learning curve; but hey,
  you are young! Plenty of time for this investment to pay off. There
  are lots of introductions to emacs on the web. Just google something
  like "emacs tutorial" and you can choose your favourite one. If you
  are wondering which emacs to install for your operating system, this
  page may help: which-emacs_. Personally, I use emacs. But there are
  lots of people who prefer:
* vi_ as editor. Most people install vim_. Also here there are lots of
  tutorials on the web.

.. [#] Feel free to install 3.0, but you will run into some
	   compatibility issues. If you know how to deal with these and
	   want to be on the cutting-edge: choose 3.0.
