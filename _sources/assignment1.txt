First Assignment
================

.. _assignment1:


For the assignment, do the following:
  
* Copy the :ref:`buttondown files <buttondown>` that you downloaded
  before.
* Edit the file "pandoc_example.md" such that it becomes
  your CV. A CV has your name at the top, well I guess you know what a
  CV is...
* Convert your CV into html using pandoc and the stylesheet
  buttondown.css.
* Publish your CV both in html and in markdown on github.
* Send us an email with the address of your github repository and the
  address with the html page of your CV. That is, as you saw
  :ref:`here <webaddress>` we want an address like
  http://janboone.github.io/second-repo/CV.html (just to be sure: this address does not exist...).

  
Note that --in case you want to show off-- there are stylesheets
especially made to render CV's in html. Google, for instance,
"markdown CV".

There is no need to do this. But if you manage to do this for the
assignment, we will be very impressed!
