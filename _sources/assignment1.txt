First Assignment
================

Copy the :ref:`buttondown files <buttondown>` that you downloaded
before. Edit the file "pandoc_example.md" such that it becomes
your CV. Covert your CV into html using pandoc and the stylesheet
buttondown.css. Publish your CV both in html and in markdown on
github.

Note that --in case you want to show off-- there are stylesheets
especially made to render CV's in html. Google, for instance,
"markdown CV".

There is no need to do this. But if you manage, we will be very
impressed!
